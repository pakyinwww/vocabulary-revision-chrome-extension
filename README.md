# Word Notebook Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that helps you build vocabulary by recording words and the URLs where you first encountered them — because context is key to remembering new words.

Inspired by [vocabulary-revision-lite](https://github.com/pakyinwww/vocabulary-revision-lite).

## Features

- **Right-click to save** — Highlight any word on a webpage and right-click to save it along with the page URL
- **Vocabulary list** — Browse all saved words with their source links and timestamps
- **First-run onboarding** — Language selection on first launch
- **Settings** — Configure language, new-tab behaviour, and reset to defaults
- **Bilingual UI** — English and Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)

## Tech Stack

- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + npm workspaces
- **Popup**: Vite + React + Mantine UI + React Router + react-i18next
- **Background**: Vite + TypeScript (Chrome service worker)
- **Storage**: `chrome.storage.local` (config) + IndexedDB (vocabulary)
